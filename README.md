We are excited to announce the launch of our new website for our upcoming Coding School! The website features five main pages: Home, About, Services, Contact, Login, and Sign Up.

The Home page provides an overview of our school and what we offer.

The About page shares our mission, vision, and team background.

On the Services page, visitors can explore our course offerings, presented in a detailed and organized table format.

The Contact page allows users to get in touch with us directly.

The Login page enables existing members to sign in and access their accounts.

The Sign Up page allows new users to register and enroll in classes easily.

We designed the website to be user-friendly, informative, and a one-stop destination for anyone interested in learning to code.
